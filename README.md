## Git vs. GitHub
* **Github** is the storage of files and other code-related stuff in the cloud for yourself and/or others to collaborate on.
  * The code is stored in the cloud up high above.
  * It tracks any changes made and organizes it.
  * It allows for collaboration on files.
  * **IT REQUIRES GIT**
* **Git** is the collection of "snapshots" of your code.
  * **IT DOESN'T REQUIRE GITHUB**

---
## Initial Setup

- In order to start using github to organize your stuff, you'll need a github account  
  1) Go over to <https://github.com/>
  2) Look around for the huge "sign up" tab in the center-right of the screen or the top right.
  3) Make your account and sign into it.
        1. To do this, you need to enter a name, e-mail, and password for your new account.
        2. Next, choose bewteen the two plans- public and private. For this tutorial, public is recommended.
        3. There will be a survey at the end that you can choose to fill out or ignore. Once this is done, your account is completed!
- Now that you have your account for github, you'll have to set-up a SSH key.
  1) On the top right next to the 'PLUS (+)' is your profile icon. Click that.
  2) It should bring out a list, you'll want to click the settings.
  3) Then on the left, click the tab that is called "SSH and GPG keys"
  4) Now you'll want to make a **NEW SSH KEY** not a GPG key.
     * It should have two empty boxes labelled title and key. Title it whatever makes most sense to you.
     * For the key, you'll need to head on over to <https://c9.io/>. You should have an account already and if not, make one.
       1) Now that you're on c9.io, find the gear icon on the top right and click that.
       2) You should be at a page that shows your account settings, find the one that is called **SSH Keys** and click that.
       3) There should be two large blocks of text, *(the text is like a password but it's so random no one would be able to figure it out)*, copy the entire block under the tab called "Connect to your private git repository".
  4) Now that you have the SSH key to connect github and c9, go back to github and dump that key into the box labelled "key".
  5) Finally, add the new SSH key. Bam, you're done setting up the connection between c9 and github!
  6) But wait, you need to authenticate your SSH key so you'll need to head into your c9 IDE (*Internal Development Environment*) and then enter this `ssh -T git@github.com`.
     * To make sure you got this right, you should see `Hi <your username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access._` in your command box (usually on the bottom tab called bash - "insert your username")

---
## Repository Setup  

* After you have set up your SSH keys and everything else, you'll want to have a directory or a place where you want to tinker around.
   1) First things first, make your directory and in the command box labelled "bash - your username", type in `git init`.
      * What `git init` does will initialize your directory and turn it into a local repository. You'll know when you see (master) right next to the directory name you're in. Ex: `/workspace/insert-directory (master) $`.
* Now that you have made your local repository, you're free to tinker and code as you like.
  1) If you're satisfied with whatever changes or files you made, you need to add them to the staging area. Do this by typing in `git add` in the command box. Keep this in mind, there are different types commands to add, `git add filename`, `git add .`, and `git add --all`.
     * `git add filename` will add the file you specified with changes made and only that file to the stage.
     * `git add .` will add all current files within the directory that has changes to them to the stage
     * `git add --all` will add all files with changes in them, including deleted files, to the stage.
  2) After you've added your changes to the staging area, you can commit them. Whenever you commit, it's necessary to add a message of what you've done in between your previous and current commit. If it's the first commit, add a message of what you've done so far. Do this by entering `git commit -m "insert message"` into the command box.
  3) Alright! You have your commit now, but what do you do? You need to send it off to a remote repository using `git push`.
     1) Head on over back to the github website and find the PLUS (+) symbol to the left of your profile icon on the top right.
     2) Click it and then a list should appear, click the one that says "New repository".
     3) Name the new repository the **EXACT SAME** as your directory name.
        * If you don't, the next steps will not work for you. _So make sure you have it the exact same!_
     4) Leave everything as is unless you know what you're doing or you've been instructed to change it and create the new repository.
     5) You'll be brought to a new tab where it explains to you what you should to in order to push to this repository on github, **MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE SSH SELECTED!!**
        * After you select SSH (if you haven't done so already), find the strips of code underneath "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line" since we've made the local repository earlier.
           1)  You'll want to copy the first strip that is `git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/repo-name.git` and paste it into your c9 command box. What this does is creates a connection between your local repository which is the one in c9 to the one you made on github which is the remote repository.
           2) Now'll you'll want to copy the second strip of code underneath the first one which is `git push -u origin master`. What this will does is it make the remote repository you've connected to the default repository for commits to be pushed into and only for that directory.
     6) Excellent, you have your connection between the local and remote repository now! You'll want to push your commits so that it stays in the remote for your future use or anyone else to use. Type in `git push` in bash and note, **it will only push COMMITS.** You won't need to specify where you want to push it to every single time because of you already set a default repository to push everything to.
     7) If you want to check your connection, you type in `git remote -v`.

## Workflow & Commands  
There are also some basic commands you should be using:  
* `cd`, it changes the directory. If you want to move up a directory, you use `cd directory name` or if you want to move back one, you use `cd ..` Note, it will on change into directories it sees, so if you want to cd into a previous directory but it doesn't exist in the directory you're on, it won't do anything.
* `mkdir`, it makes a new directory within a directory if you're inside of one, you use `mkdir directory name`.
* `rm`, it removes files. There are different types of `rm` that does something similar.
  * If you want to remove an empty directory, you use `rmdir directory name`
  * If you want to remove a directory with files entirely, you use `rm -rf directory name`
* `touch`, it will create a new file within the directory (if you're inside one), you use `touch filename`


  * Usually, after setting up your local and remote repository AND the connection between both, you're free to do whatever you want for your code now. There are, however, some habits you should pick up for whenever you begin coding.
  1) The first habit and the most necessary is to use `git status` almost every single time you enter your local repository and whenever you make some changes. What `git status` does is that it shows you if changes has been made to a file and if it has to be staged first. If it needs to be sent to the stage, the text should appear in red as "modified: insert-filename.md". If not, you should appear as green.
  2) Alright, if you have changes you want to start sending up to the remote, you'll need to check if it's red through `git status`. If it is, then use the aforementioned `git add` commands to stage the changes and it should now appear as green if you use `git status` again.
  3) Now that you have your changes staged, you'll need to commit them so use `git commit -m "insert whatever msg makes sense that sums up what you've done in between commits"`. This will make a commit.
  4) Now you'll be wondering "so what, I don't see my new changes on github". This is where `git push` comes in, you quite literally "push" your changes to the remote repository from the local repository so that the changes are now on github. Others can now "pull" the new changes and work off of that and you can also do the same if you accidentally _or purposefully_ deleted your local repository to get the commits you've pushed to.
  * Anywho, these are the four habits that you should always do for any small or big changes you've made to file(s)!

## Rolling Back Changes
  * Oh no! You made a mistake, how will you fix that?
    * You can't exactly just "contrl + z" to revert the mistakes though. You'll need to use commands to 'rollback' or go back to a previous commit in order to get previous work back.  
    This is how you do it:
    1) To rollback back from a commit to before you add changes to the stage, you'll want to use `git reset HEAD~1`.
       * This will bring you back to editing and you'll need to re-add any further changes back to the stage in order to commit.
    2) If you want to go back from a commit to the staging area, you'll need to use `git reset --soft HEAD~1`.
       * This will bring you back to the staging area where git status would show it as green.
    3) If you want to roll back a push, you can't sadly. You'd have to 'nuke' or destroy the commit you've pushed using `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.
       * You won't be able to use or go back to the deleted commit after doing this so heads up. You can however, retrieve it using `git reflog` followed by `git checkout -b`. 
       * `git reflog` will give you a list of commits you've made as reference IDs.
       * `git checkout -b` will allow you to retreive the specified commit. (after you type in `git checkout -b`, you need to put in the reference ID of the commit you want to retrieve, ex: `git checkout -b 5effc3`).  
  - Well now you've got it all figured out in order to rollback some changes! Congratulations!

## Etc.
  * If you want to collaborate or have others use your repository, you'll need to send the latest commits to the remote and from there, your partners or others "fork it"
